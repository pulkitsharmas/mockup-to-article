Your response goes here!

I have learned about the html structure and it's resemblence with the tree structure.
I learned about various elements like the p, img, hr, sub, heading elements, br and various others.
I learned how to translate mockups to html by formatting texts.
It was not that hard what i expected it to be. However it was time consuming.
I didn't give up! when i finished completing my translation of mockup, I ended up with some undesired output however with Continous refinement i came closer to mockup design.
